				In the midst of the all odds these missionaries came to Kurichi during the year 1900 and started their good work. As usual in 1901, a school was opened and later and a church was established like any other area in Kurichi also. As our memory
				goes back it was Miss. Kenny who arrived at Kurichi in 1901 sowed the first seed of gospel and the people who came to the Lord remained faithful to God. As per the information taken from the biography of Mr. and Mrs. Dawson, Miss. Kenny by
				the grace of God started night schools in Tamil after much hard work in Kurichi she was able to win the heart of many souls for Christ and they started to worship the Lord. During this period in order to have the permanent place of worship,
				Rev. Merriweather approached the government and was able to get the place where we worship the Lord and it attained hundredth year celebration on 4th of April 2012. The Lord provided a permanent place of worship through the government
				officials, 17 souls baptized on 1917 and that was the first soldiers who joined in the army of god to march forward to establish a church in Kurichi. That was our first generation. After Dawson, in 1928 Miss. Elwood came as Missionary at
				Antiyur and she was taking care of our church. And in 1930 Mr. Maccarthy came to sathy which was our local headquarters at that time. After this Rev. Merriweather came to sathiyamangalam and took charge after learning our Tamil language. Rev.
				Merriweather seeing the potential of the harvest in Kurichi. He devoted his life to improve the school and the church at Kurichi. Having learnt English and acquired some knowledge to read and write this converts became teachers and through
				the school they started assisting the missionary in the ministry. Mr. Sathiaynathan and Mr.Benjamin were the first pioneers who joined in this army to educate and elevate the status of our society in Kurichi. In the year 1943, there was
				another revival and many took baptism in the church at Kurichi.
				Rev. Albert who is physically now no more with us has dedicated his life right from 1965 till 2007 nearly 42 years served earnestly, honestly and faithfully in this Kruichi church. From 1972 to 1974 Mr. Mrs. G.W. Worrells took charge at
				anthiyur they too were very enthusiastic about the growth of the ministry at Kurichi done by Rev. Albert. In 1970s it is heartening to note that it was our pride and pleasure that our beloved brother D.G.S Dinakaran ministered in our church
				many times during those years. In 1982 Rev. Raja. M. Selvaraj took charge of the mission field.

				The first generation Christian Mr. Gnanamuthu though illiterate was the remarkable a strong believer who stood as the pillar and was considered as a prophet of that era because of power of God that was in him through the prayer. His prayers
				brought wonders and God used to answer his prayer through miracles. Right from 1970 to 2007 number of convention and spiritual meetings were conducted and through those meetings number of young people accepted Christ as their personal savior.
				After the demise of Rev. Albert, it is heartening to note that the mantle of the ministry have been taken over with the same amount of burden and carried out the responsibility by the three children of Rev. Albert and his wife.

				We seek your prayer, support and cooperation for the further growth of our CIGM Merriweather Memorial church Kurichi, in all the fields specially in enriching our people spiritually and socially. We praise God for His faithfulness.

				Towards the end of my second year at the B.T.I. I was accepted by the Ceylon and India General Mission for service in India. On November the 10th 1908, I set sail, along with Mr. Borthwick, Mr. Salway, and Mr. Tew. The last two lie buried in India, having laid down their lives for Christ and India.
    Arriving in India Mr. Borthkwick and I were sent to Satyamangalam in the Tamil field where we soon settled down to language study. Early in my second year I was sent to a Jungle village off the beaten track called Kurichee where a lady missionary had been living in a native house, carrying on a night school teaching the young converts and others to read Tamil.  (Miss Kenny)
    When I arrived in the village there was no one who spoke English. I bravely started with my limited Tamil to teach. Upwards of twenty men used to come down nightly to the verandah for study. It was alright teaching the alphabet and simple phrases, but when they turned round and in an involved sentence asked a question, I was more often "up a tree" than not! Often we had to get a slate and draw pictures to try and find out what was meant. We were anxious that the young illiterate Christians should have the Word of God hidden in their hearts; so we finished up with a time of memorizing Scripture verses and prayer.
		<br>
They were very sympathetic to me, alone among them, and one night when I called on a man to lead in prayer, he began by saying, "Dear Lord, we can go to our homes, we have our wives and our families, the poor missionary is here alone, please send him a wife." I think the missionary said "Amen, Lord!" This was not so bad at night school, but some weeks later
when I asked this good brother to lead in prayer in the morning service, he began in his simple way to remind the Lord that He hadn't sent the wife yet. Well, it began to be embarrassing!
<br>
It was this man, who had come to Miss Kenny some time before, when she was teaching him John 3:16 and had said that this verse kept speaking to him and he wanted to believe. He knelt there on the verandah and yielded himself to Christ. He never did learn to read, but he memorized Scripture and could use it. One of his daughters became Head Mistress of one of our girl’s schools; she was a little saint of God.
<br>
One of his sons studied law and speaks English perfectly. His mother, a petty priestess, was so amazed at the change that had come into his life from the day he accepted Christ, that she one day came to the Mission house to say that she wanted what her son had got. There on the verandah she knelt and accepted Christ as her Saviour. The change that had been wrought in his life was wrought in hers.  When a scourge of Cholera broke out, the villagers believed that the Goddess of Cholera had been offended and thus she had sent this scourge. The villagers would then surround the Priestess with their Tom-toms and play faster and faster until she would be worked up into a state of frenzy. Then suddenly she would become possessed of the goddess as they would say, (really Demon possession) and under it’s control she would tell them what they must do to appease the wrath of the goddess.
<br>
Soon after the baptism of the priestess Cholera broke out, and the villagers came beseeching her to come under control of the goddess. She replied that Jesus now lived in her heart and it would be impossible for her to make room for the devil. She used to tell how they came and sat round her hut and played their Tom-toms in a devilish frenzy, in order to bring her under control.  She went inside and prayed until they saw it was no use and went away. With a smile she would say, "And the goddess has never been back since."
<br>
An outcaste widow's son from this village, a poor sickly fellow, was taken into the boarding home and the Missionary who took him in, and has mothered him, has been well rewarded. He has been the pastor of our largest Tamil Church for many years. Two of our finest Bible-women, who are working among Muslims, are daughters of two of the first Christians of that village.
